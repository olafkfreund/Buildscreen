Park Square Consulting Azure DevOps Buildscreen
===============================================

View the latest builds from your Azure DevOps and on-premise Team Foundation Server projects.

This project is a modernized resurrection of the original open source project by (now defunct) Orbit One.

We've streamlined the service layer to use the latest Azure DevOps REST APIs for best performance, improved the styling, fixed some
bugs, and migrated the whole thing to .Net Core.

Supported statuses
------------------

* Grey: queued
* Blue: in progress
* Green: succeeded
* Yellow: partially succeeded (usually due to failing tests)
* Red: failed
* Purple: stopped

Build tiles now have links to additional information within AzDO for swift assessment of the problem without losing valuable time.

How to Use
----------

You can build the app and run it locally or deploy the binaries in your favourite manner (Kestrel, IIS, etc.)

Or you can use the latest pre-built Docker image available on DockerHub ![alt tag](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/parksq/buildscreen?style=plastic)

        -e AzureDevOpsProvider:ProjectCollection="projectcolletion"
        -e AzureDevOpsProvider:Projects="comma,delimited,list"
